      <p> Hourglass Travel is a division of My Travel Elf and was started nearly 7 years ago on the premise that nothing beats concierge service, the value of time, and custom intinerary planning. While many internet sites promise special deals, travelers are often unaware of indifference to budget, lack of personalized attention, and assistance with the details. Making the right choices based on price alone is not always the best course of action for travelers. We hear too many stories from clients regretting that they didn't call us first. </p>
      <p> Beth Cox recognized the need for concierge assistance and planning in the internet age. While many agents succumb to the pressure of bargain internet sites, Beth recognized the niche for knowledgeable travel professionals who custom plan an experience rather than a vacation. She knew that travelers would appreciate the values of a boutique travel planner. Many travelers learned that they actually saved time in the planning process and maximized time when reaching their vacation destination  by seeking the planning services of an experienced travel planner. Beth wanted to emphasize the value of time in vacationing and decided to call her agency, "Hourglass Travel". </p>
      <p> Beth has spent nearly a decade in the industry and is now recognized widely among Disney Fans. She focuses her efforts on planning vacations for clients to Disney Resorts, Disney Cruise lines and Adventures by Disney as a travel planner offering concierge services. She has also worked with many host agencies over the years, but knew she could best serve travelers by creating an agency that was focused on client needs. She was determined to prove that her agency could prove better service and value than any other means of travel planning. She was right. Hourglass Travel has experienced continual growth on referral alone. Beth is proud to be recognized as leading travel planner for clients that want magical moments and memories. </p>
